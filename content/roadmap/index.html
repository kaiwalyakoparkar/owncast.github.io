    While nothing is set in stone, Owncast tries to set a relatively clear
    roadmap for future work and features. This enables the project to discuss
    things far in advance to make the best possible decisions as well as
    allowing Owncast users to know what types of updates they can expect.
  </p>
  <p>
    As time goes on planning for specific releases get more detailed, and it's
    very common for additional, smaller, releases to get slipped in between
    larger features to fix bugs and address feedback.

        <h2>v0.2.0 Backend and web API refactor</h2>
        <p>
          Much like the frontend was refactored, it's time to start reorganizing and
          cleaning up the architecture of the backend. This begins with the API layer, and
          making additional steps from there. This sets the backend up for the exciting
          feature work that is scheduled next. These updates will happen in meaningful,
          but iterative chunks within v0.2.x releases. See milestone for details.
